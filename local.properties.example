## Copy this file to local.properties and set the path to your Android SDK
# Example for Windows (PowerShell / cmd):
# sdk.dir=C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
# Example for macOS/Linux:
# sdk.dir=/Users/<YourUser>/Library/Android/sdk

# Uncomment and update the line below with your SDK path
# sdk.dir=

# Note: local.properties is intentionally not checked into git because it contains
# machine-specific configuration. Copy this file to local.properties in the repo
# root and set sdk.dir to your Android SDK installation path to enable building
# with the Gradle wrapper.
